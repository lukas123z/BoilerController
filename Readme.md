This project is written in Visual Studio 2015 with vMicro add-on to use on ESP8266 12-E, but all ESP8266s with at least 3 GPIOs should work correctly. If you have only 2 GPIOs you must renounce from diode or switch.
It will connect to server on Raspberry Pi3, but app isn't wiritten yet ;)

Sheme of connections not avaiable yet, maybe tomorrow ;)

If you want set your own ssid, ip etc. you must change Definitions.h file

#### IMPORTANT!! ####
EEPROMManager isn't tested , in my ESP8266 EEPROM doesn't work correctly and i can't test it, but i left it, because maybe it will be usefull for you.
